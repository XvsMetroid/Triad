  2. **Measure**: Automatic generation of realistic metrics and KPIs
  3. **Learn**: AI-generated insights from data analysis
  4. **Adapt**: Guided policy refinement suggestions
- Iteration tracking and progress visualization
- Sample metrics include satisfaction rates, economic impact, and implementation costs

### üéØ **Governance Scenarios**
- Four real-world governance challenges:
  - **Climate Crisis**: Carbon pricing and environmental policy
  - **Economic Inequality**: Wealth redistribution and social mobility
  - **AI Governance**: AI safety and democratic oversight
  - **Healthcare Reform**: Universal access and cost control
- Editable policy proposals with real-time Triad alignment analysis
- Automated scoring and improvement recommendations

### üîç **Meta-Monitor Dashboard**

- **Architecture**: Modular JavaScript with class-based organization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Python 3.x (for local development server)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XvsMetroid/Triad.git
cd Triad
```

2. Start a local development server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

### Usage

1. **Navigation**: Use the top navigation bar to switch between sections
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
   - `Ctrl/Cmd + 1-5`: Quick section navigation
3. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Click principle cards for detailed information
   - Use the feedback loop simulator to test policy iterations
   - Edit policy proposals in scenarios for real-time analysis
   - Monitor system health through the Meta-Monitor dashboard

## Framework Overview

The Sovereign Triad is built on three foundational principles:

- **Truth**: Empirical accuracy and transparent reality assessment
- **Wisdom**: Ethical judgment and long-term strategic thinking  
- **Humanity**: Fundamental human dignity and flourishing

### Operational Mechanisms

- **Feedback Loop**: Act ‚Üí Measure ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Adapt cycle
- **Meta-Monitor**: Second-order oversight preventing corruption and drift
- **Fractal Architecture**: Self-similar patterns scaling across organizational levels

## Key Features Implementation

### Real-time Policy Analysis
The simulator uses keyword analysis to score policies against Triad principles:
- **Truth**: Looks for evidence-based language and measurement commitment
- **Wisdom**: Identifies long-term thinking and stakeholder consideration
- **Humanity**: Detects human-centered language and rights protection

### Dynamic Visualizations
- Animated progress bars and gauges using CSS transitions
- Interactive hover effects and click animations
- Responsive design adapting to all screen sizes
- Color-coded system health indicators

### Scenario-Based Learning
Four comprehensive governance scenarios with:
- Detailed challenge descriptions
- Sample policy proposals
- Real-time alignment scoring
- Specific improvement recommendations

## Contributing
