# Triad

## Overview
Triad is a philosophical framework for building adaptive, ethical governance systems. It is based on the Sovereign Triad principles—Truth, Wisdom, and Humanity—and provides a blueprint for ethical decision-making, continuous adaptation, and principled governance at all scales.

## Features
- Principle-based architecture for governance
- Feedback loops for continuous learning and adaptation
- Meta-Monitor for system-wide oversight and integrity
- Fractal architecture scaling from individuals to global systems
- Implementation proposals for AI ethics, constitutional reform, and organizational design

## Interactive Simulator
This repository now includes a web-based interactive simulator to explore the Sovereign Triad framework. It allows you to:
- Visualize the fractal architecture across different scales.
- See the Feedback Loop in action.
- Write and test policy scenarios to see how they align with the Triad principles.
- Receive real-time alignment scores and contextual feedback from the corpus.

To use it, open the `simulator/index.html` file in your web browser.

## Corpus
The repository includes a rich, analysis-ready corpus (`triad_corpus.json`) parsed from the philosophical operating system described in `sovereign_triad_corpus.md`. Each paragraph is annotated with section metadata for easy AI analysis.

## Getting Started
1. Review `sovereign_triad_corpus.md` for the full philosophical framework.
2. Use `triad_corpus.json` for data-driven analysis, training, or research.
3. Adapt the principles and mechanisms for your own governance, organizational, or AI ethics projects.

## Structure
- `sovereign_triad_corpus.md`: Source document of the Triad framework
- `triad_corpus.json`: Machine-readable corpus for analysis
