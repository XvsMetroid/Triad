# Copilot Instructions for Triad

## Project Overview
This repository contains the **Sovereign Triad** philosophical framework - a governance system based on three core principles: **Truth**, **Wisdom**, and **Humanity**. The project provides both human-readable philosophy (`sovereign_triad_corpus.md`) and machine-readable data (`triad_corpus.json`) for analysis and implementation.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### The Triad Structure
All content follows a three-pillar architecture:
- **Truth**: Evidence-based, verifiable reality (data integrity, transparency)
- **Wisdom**: Contextual application of truth (practical ethics, long-term thinking)
- **Humanity**: Human dignity and flourishing (individual agency, collective benefit)

When working with this codebase, ensure any additions or modifications align with all three principles simultaneously.

### The Fractal Pattern
The framework scales from individual → organizational → societal → global levels. When adding content or analysis, consider how concepts apply across these four scales. Reference the existing fractal sections in `sovereign_triad_corpus.md` for examples.

### The Feedback Loop Mechanism
Core operational pattern: **Act → Measure → Learn → Adapt**
- All proposals should include measurement criteria
- Analysis should identify what can be learned from current state
- Recommendations should suggest adaptive mechanisms

## Key Files and Their Purposes

### `sovereign_triad_corpus.md`
The authoritative source document containing the complete philosophical framework. Structured in 8 main parts:
- Parts I-III: Foundational theory
- Part IV: Concrete implementation proposals (P-01 through P-04)  
- Parts V-VIII: Axioms, applications, and limitations

### `triad_corpus.json`
Machine-readable corpus with section/subsection metadata for each paragraph. Use this for:
- Data analysis and pattern recognition
- Training or fine-tuning AI models
- Programmatic content extraction
- Cross-referencing philosophical concepts

### `README.md`
User-facing documentation explaining the repository's purpose and structure.

## Content Conventions

### Implementation Proposals
Use the P-XX numbering format (P-01, P-02, etc.) for concrete implementation ideas. Each should specify:
- Which Triad principle(s) it primarily serves
- The feedback loop mechanism it employs
- How the Meta-Monitor would audit it

### Foundational Sayings
Key philosophical quotes are numbered and include explanatory context. When adding new axioms, follow this pattern and ensure they don't contradict the "proto-principle" that "There is always an exception."

### Meta-Monitor Concept
Any governance mechanism must include a "who watches the watchers" component. When proposing systems, always include oversight mechanisms that audit for alignment drift.

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding Content
- Maintain philosophical coherence with existing framework
- Include measurement/validation considerations
- Consider fractal scalability (does this work at all four levels?)
- Reference specific examples from real-world governance challenges

### When Analyzing Data
- Use `triad_corpus.json` for quantitative analysis
- Preserve section/subsection context when extracting insights
- Look for patterns across the fractal levels
- Identify gaps or contradictions in the framework

### When Creating Derivatives
- Cite the original Triad framework appropriately
- Maintain the principle-based architecture
- Include adaptation mechanisms rather than rigid rules
- Consider both philosophical depth and practical implementation

## Critical Limitations to Consider
The framework acknowledges its own limitations (Part VIII):
- Assumes rational actors (may not handle bad-faith participation)
- Lacks power transition theory (how to implement against resistance)
- Requires cultural translation while maintaining integrity
- Provides destination without detailed implementation journey

When working with this codebase, be mindful of these constraints and avoid overstating the framework's completeness.
